# ShinyAppWithD3Visualization
This repository was created by Mike Seman demoing his Shiny/R App with d3 visualization.

To run the D3 visualization app with R and Shiny download the repo and then in Rstudio set the working directory to <b>ShinyAppWithD3Visualization</b>. 

Next you want to make sure <b>shiny</b> and <b>rjson</b> is installed by using the package installer in Rstudio. Finally to run you can use the Rstudio to run these two commands: 

<b>library(shiny) 

runApp()</b>

Enjoy looking through the code to understand and make sure to check out [Machine Learning Davidson](https://mldavidson.wordpress.com/) for other presentations and project demos.
